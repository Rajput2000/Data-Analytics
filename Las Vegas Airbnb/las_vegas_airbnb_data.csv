Entire condo,4.54,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",4,Doug,,"Overall, I had a good experience. The only downside would be that check in was a bit difficult. We got to the location we were sent, and was told at the gate that we were at the wrong location. After messaging the host, he let us know we would be going to a different location. After a long day of traveling, it was very inconvenient that we went to the wrong location. A little bit more communication would've went a long way. Also, some type of early check in or bag drop off would've helped a lot. We were told by a lot of people from the area that it is common for the flights that the times are very weird. You either are coming into Vegas very early in the morning or late at night. It was difficult finding flights close to check in. The apartment did not match the pictures at all; appeared to be a different unit. Could use a slight spruce up of fixing things around the condo. Furniture seemed a little old and worn.",4.0

Entire condo,,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",4,Aaron&Tina,,"Immediately after booking, the host messaged me and told me the dates I booked weren’t available, saying they wouldn’t be in town to check me in to the property, and I couldn’t get access without them being there. <br/>They attempted to get me to change my dates, but I had plans in town for the dates I booked. I requested a refund multiple times over the course of more than a week & took the steps requested by the host, but never received a refund. Then the host stopped replying to my messages.<br/>I ended up having to go directly to AirBnB for my refund, and they couldn’t process it until after my stay date - 3 weeks after I booked my trip, so in the mean time, I was out hundreds of dollars. <br/>Oh, and by the way, we ended up staying at the same property, and the host doesn’t need to check you in, which is what I suspected from the beginning. It’s just a typical Vegas hotel. You go to the desk and check yourself in, and they assign you a room, so they were clearly lying to begin with. <br/>PS - since we ended up staying on the property anyway, I can confidently say it isn’t even a remotely nice place. The “jacuzzi” tub has no jets, half the stuff was broken, vending machines were sold out, staff was useless, no WiFi to speak of, and zero cell service in the building. I couldn’t even listen to music on Spotify without it dropping out every few minutes. <br/>For just a little more, you can stay at Palms Place, which is leagues above this, and where I usually stay. Do that. You’ll thank me later.",1.0

Room in hotel,4.18,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",8,888,,"Mohammad was a very unprofessional host, which lead to a terrible Airbnb experience. First of all, Mohammad overbooked the units and tried to cancel our reservation on the same day we were set to arrive in Las Vegas. We made these reservations at least six months in advance since March Madness is a very popular time to come to Vegas. He ended up making three separate reservations, so we had to switch rooms multiple times during our 5 day stay, which was a major inconvenience.<br/>A week or two before we were set to arrive, we tried to contact him to talk about the details of our stay. We probably messaged and called him 10 plus times before we received an answer a few days before our stay. He confirmed that everything was fine with our booking, which turned out to be false. This poor communication was common theme. During the confusion of switching rooms, he ignored my calls. When called by the MGM, Mohammad finally answered his phone and was even unprofessional to MGM manager (yelling at her). The Signature at MGM has had numerous problems with Mohammad and his company, AAA Tourism (which Mohammad runs and is the only employee).",1.0

Entire condo,3.67,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",6,Aaron&Tina,,"Please do NOT,  I repeat do NOT book your vacation with these hosts. It's a scam. Worst situation ever, had booked this AirBnB room about three weeks in advance, thought nothing of it since everything was verified off the app, and had noticed a couple of good reviews. On the day of arrival, I did what the host had requested and that was to give them a heads up upon arriving. Called the host, spoke to Tina who didn't sound pleasant to hear from me or let alone care that we were arriving. When I had arrived at the location, I tried to reach Tina again, who never answered my calls again, which in fact I also had tried to via message her. Since that didn't work out, I went to the check in  at the front of the hotel to see if they know anything, the location is there alright but the staff member had stated that the room we were assigned to is closed off, and no one is staying there. Mind you guys, the load of stress and anxiety I was getting and finding out we had been scammed, and stranded on top of that we drove stuck in traffic for 7 hours coming from LA. We had to find a last minute hotel to book, to top it off it was the day of my birthday ! While all that was going on, I was able to reach Airbnb support who kindly helped us get our refund back. Please be careful who you book with.",1.0

Accessing the MGM pool complex was easy & the monorail has a station in MGM so getting around is easy if you don’t want to walk.

We enjoyed having the whole group together at the place. That was awesome. Problems: The place was not clean. Walking in the house bare feet would render your soles pitch black in minutes. Only a few drops came out of one of the taps. There seems to be a lack of pressure. Some sleeping rooms have been a garage one day. The third compound could not be locked. The entry door was locked at some point, and we could not get in. It took Simon from 9:45 pm till 8:30 am the next morning to get back to us, although we dialed his number, send him text messages, and contacted him on Airbnb.

There was lots to do/enjoy at the house and we only really left to get food!  The pool/water slide and game areas were awesome. The kids spent most of the day in the pool every day and the adults had time to visit and relax.  The hosts were incredibly responsive and we communicated frequently during our stay.  Plenty of pool toys and towels for the weekend and we did wash them daily because there were a lot of us using them.  Definitely pay for the pool heating if you are going in the fall/winter as the pool really makes the house amazing for the kids.  We would 100% stay here again.",5.0

Our host messaged us the day we reserved this about 6 months ago. Not much after that didn’t ask for any information nothing. The morning we arrived in Las Vegas, she sent a AIRBNB message to us cancelled on us. She said we could communicate with her for help. We tried calling sending several messages and not a single thing back. She did not cancel the reservation officially just by telling us it was cancelled. She even said she “assumed” we were not going due to COVID.  So there we are Las Vegas 10 hours away from home with no place to stay and she has our money didn’t even try to help. I had high hopes but obviously you can’t trust anyone these days. I encourage you to enjoy a nice hotel in LV and never an Airbnb from this host.",1.0

The area seems fine but you don't really notice since you feel like you are in a compound separate from the neighborhood. This house has everything and everything is the top-notch version. it was definitely lux-living. We loved the place! The only thing that was a little bit annoying was the rule to keep the hot tub off while not using it. That made it so we couldn't use the hot tub very much because by the time we got home from a long day at the convention, we didn't really want to wait the almost 2 hours to heat it up. But the steam room made up for that. We will definitely rent this house next year for the convention.",5.0

Entire home,4.86,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",16,Arthur,,Decent place to stay if you need somewhere that accommodates a large group but not as nice as it seems. We were not able to check in early because the house was being cleaned but arrived to dirty floors. There was popcorn and trash in the movie theater room that had just been swept under the couches which were too close to the tv so when we slid them back it revealed the mess. The host scheduled their pool guy to come clean in the middle of the day while we were trying to hang out in the backyard. The pool and hot tub said they were heated but the heater did not work- we had the heater running constantly during our stay and could not get the pool or hot tub above 70 degrees so they were unusable.,4.0
Entire condo,4.88,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",12,Christopher,,"My stay at Christopher's Airbnb was a complete nightmare. The check-in process, promised to be 30-40 minutes, took a frustrating 1.5 hours. The initial disappointment was finding out our reservation, which was supposed to be a 3 bed 3 bath, was actually a 2 bed 2 bath. I reported this to Airbnb, and in an astonishing turn of events, Christopher reacted by evicting my friends from an additional 1 bed 1 bath room he'd provided to compensate for the discrepancy. <br/>This reaction, interpreting my complaint as hostile, was not only unprofessional but also deeply troubling. To make matters worse, Christopher then charged us almost the full price for our stay, despite being well aware of the <br/>accommodation issues. <br/>This experience not only shattered our expectations but also raises concerns about the professionalism and trustworthiness of hosts in the Airbnb community. I strongly advise against booking with this host if you value a hassle-free and fair stay.",1.0

Even if room is not ready, Dennis and Cindy proactively sent us message where to live bags which was already great. From hosts perspective I couldn't ask for more. Kitchen looks nice, with big refrigerator but could be a bit better equipped. Front pool looks exactly like the one in the photo and it is  heated. Really nice place to relax before going to evening events in Vegas. <br/>Other photos were not that accurate. Game room didn't have a pool table or hockey table. We didn't find a gym like the one on the photo and table tennis racquets are just plastic pieces, really not for table tennis. Two jacuzzies we found were outdoor. Saying that, maybe there is some place within a resort with all these amenities just it wasn't that obvious.<br/>Overall I think it is OK value considering it was a SB weekend.",3.0

Entire condo,,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",8,Ani,,"It was a terrible experience booking this place. The host canceled my booking on the morning of the stay even though I booked a month in advance stating that my booking was canceled because I did not provide my full name and contact number and because of that my booking was given to someone else by the resort and that the resort had no more inventory. I did not receive any reminder to provide that information considering it was such a vital information. I had been getting regular emails from AirBnb saying that I am all set for my stay but on the morning of my stay, I received the cancellation message from the host. Even after that, I continuously tried to message and call the host in order to resolve this issue because I was going to board my flight in a few hours and I did not want to be stuck at the airport with no place to live but there was absolutely no courtesy by the host to reply to my messages or calls. I spent 5-6 hours messaging the host multiple times and calling AirBnb support with no help. Due to this miscommunication, I had no place to stay at the last minute and whatever was available was too damn expensive and I had to cancel my much awaited Las Vegas trip at the last moment. This has been a pathetic experience dealing with this host and Airbnb support. Really disappointed!!",1.0

I felt like I was renting directly from the Signature. Richard uniquely offers complimentary trash removal, new towels, and a room refresh mid-stay. Paying for daily housekeeping was unnecessary as the units were spotless. The bday girl got the one-bedroom balcony suite and my family of 4 was in the adjacent deluxe suite. The sofa bed in our room was very comfy. My brother had the sofa bed in the “living room” portion of the one-bedroom suite. The additional 3/4 shower bathroom in the living room was awesome since it’s usually one bathroom per unit. The walk to the casino was much closer than expected and walking indoors, you feel like you belong to the Grand and you’re staying on the strip. Be mindful that you share a locked foyer and then you can leave each unit door open if you want to feel like you’re in one giant suite.",5.0

Super-easy to use the indoor walkway to MGM and then out to the Strip.  Getting Uber/Lyft to go further up the Strip was also really convenient right outside Tower 2's doors.  Quicker pick-up than other casinos because there isn't as much traffic at Signature.  Signature's pool area was really nice and so is the gym.  Greg knows how to be a 5.0 host - excellent communication/responsiveness and very kind as well.  The extras he provides in the unit are above and beyond - coffee, tea, snacks, breakfast items and a water dispenser.  His housekeeping team does a great job as well - it was very clean.

Big refrigerator with lot of space. At some places it was not spotless clean (under bed, oven, stove). Some broken stuff like a chair, light in the closet and we missed a knob of the stove. All small defects. Sometimes we had a little weird neighbours (smell of weed) and a little bit noisy. But at the end it was a perfect stay for the money. In the beginning the WiFi was perfect, but after 1,5 week it was terrible. Unfortunately never got back the great signal. Close to the airport and in the night no trouble with the planes.

Uber rides pretty much anywhere near the strip would be between $9-$13 per ride and arrive quickly.

Advertise free parking on premises but they also rent out the other rooms in the house so there are multiple cars being parked here from other guests, often times being left with street parking options only- something to keep in mind as there’s not a guaranteed spot for off street.

The room I stayed in was a private suite with private bathroom and came with a mini fridge, microwave, TV with Hulu/Roku, plus access to laundry and the kitchen, everything I needed to have a comfy extended stay.

The following day when I looked around the house I found used q-tips and dental floss picks left around the house.  There was hair on the walls of the master shower, dirty clothes beside and behind the washer and dryer, and many of the dishes had to be washed before I could use them.  The neighbor on the corner hosts karaoke parties at least once a week but most weeks it was at least 2 nights.  This was a problem as I worked early each morning.

Entire home,4.67,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",10,Irene,,"Do not rent this home. Irene was responsive when I reached out but the place has a price tag that made me feel so duped after renting. It’s rundown and had weird brown stains, dust and grime in the home. They had someone working in the backyard for more than half of our stay and they didn’t reach out to us about it. One of my female roommates walked out of her room in her robe and saw a man in the backyard working (on multiple days) and there weren’t blinds on the glass door in the kitchen for her to draw closed for privacy. They show the backyard as a selling point for the location, yet it was unavailable for most of our trip. I’m hoping that I can leave photos to illustrate what I mean. I asked for a partial refund and got a laughable $12.85 refund. When I asked Irene about it she said it was airbnb (which I have no reason to doubt her) but when I asked airbnb they said that’s all the host was willing to do. My roommates have stronger negative feelings about this experience.",2.0

Once we pulled into the valet area I went to check-in & that process went very smoothly. Clear & concise information from the person who checked me in. Valet service was equally as smooth. Once we got up to the room in the late afternoon, we did notice initially the drapes would not close. There's a switch on the wall that would close the drapes but that wasn't working. Notified our host & maintenance came by the next morning & resolved the issue. There were some wine stains on the carpet along with a tear on one the vinyl covers of the headboard. There was also a nick on the wall covering. Informed the owner of this & he made note of it. The price for the suite was reasonable. The MGM Grand had some nice restaurants & entertainment.

The location is not convenient and I would not recommend walking anywhere especially after dark. <br/>As far as amenities, there is only a French press for coffee and no kettle so you have to boil water in a pot on the stove and the French press only makes 2 cups.

And also 1 of the bedrooms upstairs didn’t have a night stand or small table next to either beds.

First, it was clean, spacious and very comfortable. LOTS of space, huge walk-in closet.  There is nothing located ""near"" the place, and it is at the back of a huge resort, so a 6 minute walk just to get to the front gate to catch an Uber.  But with an additional 10 minute walk you can be at the Venetian Expo center or the Sphere.   A $10 Uber ride will get you about anywhere on the strip.  The shower is in a VERY deep tub, so not for the ADA crowd. The listing said it had a ""full size washer and dryer"" which our unit did not.  Some of the units may have this amenity.  However, we didn't travel to Vegas t to do laundry so it wasn't a drawback for us.  The other amenities were remarkably good.  The knives were sharp, which is amazing.

We ate at the BEST brunch restaurant, Hash House A Go Go, in the Linq hotel. The food was top notch but beware, the portions are huge so share a plate if you can. The ability to share makes the food more affordable. We also had a really affordable breakfast at Ocean 1, in Miracle Mile and it was close by as well. <br/>Brooke was a really proactive and attentive host.

Spring Valley also has a shocking bit of amazing eats in strip malls close by. Strip was close and so was Red Rock Canyon. Complex has great security and feels very safe however the office never got back to me so I didn’t get to download the community app and use the pool (not a biggie.)

Brent was proactive in his communication and having stayed in many airbnbs over the years this was one of the best. Thanks so much and would absolutely come back.,5.0
Entire home,4.93,"Henderson, Nevada, United States",10,Eddie And Michelle,,"House was perfect for our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids)!

Honestly could not have asked for a better experience.  Will recommend to others and hope to stay again.  Thank you for everything!",5.0

Nice relaxing backyard with grass and beautiful roses. <br/>Such a great location just minutes to the strip or downtown. Right in the middle of everything but on a nice quiet street. <br/>I cannot say enough good things about the Hosts! They absolutely made our stay amazing. Very helpful and thoughtful. <br/>I can’t thank them enough for being so kind and attentive and making our stay so comfortable. We will definitely miss the house and Hosts! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5.0

Location was very close to everything I needed while being in a quiet and safe location which can be hard to find in Vegas. There was plenty of lighting and  designated close by parking spot which made it feel safe/secure. The unit was nice and had everything you would need for a long stay (plates/silverware/tupperware/laundry machine/coffee machine etc). The few very minor things that came up, Tamara was very responsive and very quick to offer solutions/help. I would stay there again if/when I come back to Vegas!",5.0

You do have to use your room key to get to your condo which was a huge plus!. Our hallway and room was So peaceful and secure. The view from our balcony was absolutely amazing We loved having coffee out on the patio every morning. The inside had everything needed as far as basic utensils and a mini fridge. The bed was very comfortable, in fact we slept in longer than expected because of how relaxed we were. Walking distance from the strip and 10 minutes walking distance from MGM which is all inside, they also have moving walkways. We enjoyed the swimming pool that was surrounded by beautiful scenery and good music. We did wish the pool was open longer It closed at 4:00 p.m. also they were not serving drinks or food however they did allow us to bring in our own. The security was super helpful look for DOROTHY She was excellent with providing information and is very knowledgeable of the property.",5.0

Entire condo,4.9,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States",4,Las Vegas Condo Rentals,,"MGM Signature is a great place to stay. Its connected to MGM Grand and the tram.  So much cheeper to use tram than Uber or Lyft.  MGM is walkable to everything. The room was as described. The bed was soft and room overall comfy. The cleaning service is less than desirable. The main areas were clean. There were plenty of towels. They can do a better job with the kitchen and bathroom.  The views of Vegas were amazing. For the comfortability, location and convenience this is definitely worth it. I highly recommend! Target is around the corner for any food needs. Walgreens is walking distance. Hotel Breakfast is obnoxiously priced. Cook your own breakfast or get a few things at Target. Front desk is super friendly. Driving is a nightmare.  You dont need a car. But should you bring one, parking is free at the hotel. Valet is super chill.",4.0

The neighborhood was clean and quiet, and anything we needed was a quick drive away. <br/>We were in town to see family, so the large open down stairs coupled with the pool table was great.
